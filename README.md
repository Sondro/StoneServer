A modded minecraft bedrock edition server

Modified from MrARM's mcpelauncher-server for cloud-native

## Difference from MrARM's mcpelauncher-server
Removed features: 
1. Read command from stdin
2. Custom arguments

Added features:
1. APID Interface
2. Designed for container runtime (docker or my nsroot)
3. Scripting Feature! (with some custom scripting api)
